# An-online-File-Sharing-Portal
My final year mini project of Distributed Systems. I have slightly modified the RMI Architecture. This code is just a simple implementation of encrypting true links to protect it from direct downloaders. In this way, you can ensure that the users visit your website first before getting the file they want.

Program Features:
1. Basic Encryption and Decryption using Base64
2. Open link to New Tab using Button
3. Copying text to clipboard on Button Click
4. HTML5 Validation
5. Create SEO friendly URL using .htaccess

Framework and Theme(s) used:
1. Bootstrap from https://getbootstrap.com
2. HttpErrorPages from https://github.com/AndiDittrich/HttpErrorPages

Change it to your IP Address beacause mine was 192.168.1.2 and you might not have the same.

Feel free to use this code but remember to give credits to [this person](https://github.com/AzharMithani)
